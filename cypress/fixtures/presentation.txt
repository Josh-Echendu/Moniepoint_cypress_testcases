Step 1: Test Data Setup


Cypress prepares the transaction scenario by gathering all necessary information:

Terminal identification details

Merchant account information

Transaction amount and currency

Unique transaction identifiers

Timestamp and location data

This creates a realistic withdrawal transaction scenario for testing


Step 2: Security Authentication

Cypress generates a digital security signature using:

A secret security key

All transaction details combined

Cryptographic hashing algorithm

This ensures the transaction is secure and authenticated, just like real banking transactions


Step 3: Database Command
Cypress sends the database instruction to the backend system:

Packages the SQL command with all transaction data

Sends it to the local Django API endpoint

Includes proper authentication headers

This initiates the process of recording the transaction in the system


Step 4: Backend Processing
Django receives and executes the command:

Processes the SQL instruction securely

Inserts the transaction record into the database

Creates a complete financial transaction entry

The backend system handles the actual database operations


Step 5: Response Return
Django sends back the results:

Retrieves the newly created transaction record

Confirms successful database operation

Returns the complete transaction details

This provides proof that the transaction was properly recorded
