TestCSE is a full-stack end-to-end testing framework designed to validate Django REST Framework (DRF) APIs using Cypress as the testing client.

This project demonstrates how to:

Interact with DRF endpoints programmatically

Perform CRUD operations on the database via DRF

Execute automated front-end workflows with Cypress

Validate API responses and database changes in real time

It is ideal for developers who want to test web applications with a decoupled front-end (Cypress) and backend (DRF) setup.
